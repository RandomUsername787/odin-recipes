    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>This Burger Recipe covers everything needed to make delightful veggie burgers
       from scratch, including how to prepare and pan fry delicious homemade 
       vegetable patties. And because no veggie burger is complete without its own 
       special sauce, I have included instruction on how to make the perfect tangy, 
       sweet and spicy mayonnaise dressing.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 sliced onion</li>
        <li>4 slices cheese slices</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon powdered garam masala powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoon refined oil</li>
        <li>1/2 gm ginger paste</li>
        <li>4 halved burger buns</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon tomato ketchup</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic paste</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the cooked vegetables, chopped onions, red 
        chilli powder, lemon juice, garam masala powder, 
        salt and ginger-garlic paste to a large bowl.</li>

        <li>Add lemon juice and mashed potatoes in the bowl, 
        mix well until evenly combined. Shape the mixture 
        into small/medium patties.</li>

        <li>Now heat oil in a pan over medium flame. 
        Roll the prepared patties in the breadcrumbs and 
        shallow fry until golden brown on both sides.</li>

        <li>Remove and keep aside.</li>

        <li>Take one half of the burger bun. Spread some 
        butter and place the lettuce on top.</li>

        <li>Place the prepared vegetable patty on top. Top up 
        with slices of onion, tomato, cucumber and cheese. If you 
        want to make it even more delicious and healthy replace 
        cheese with eggless mayonnaise.</li>

        <li>Cover it with the other half of the burger bun. If desired, 
        add some ketchup on top. Secure it with a toothpick if desired.</li>
    </ol>
