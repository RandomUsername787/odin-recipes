    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cup all purpose flour</li>
        <li>100 ml tomato ketchup</li>
        <li>1 tomato</li>
        <li>2 onion</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chilli flakes</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>100 gm processed cheese</li>
        <li>4 mushroom</li>
        <li>1/2 capsicum (green pepper)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon oregano</li>
        <li>1/2 cup mozzarella</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dry yeast</li>
        <li>water as required</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Of the basic tips is to make sure that you have preheated 
        the oven. In case you are using a standard oven then make sure 
        it’s preheated at 280 degree Celsius.</li>

        <li>In case you are using a readymade base, make sure it’s not cold. 
        Make sure that you take it out half an hour before you start 
        making the pizza.</li>

        <li>Don’t roll the dough, stretch it to make the base. This means if 
        you are making the fresh pizza base, the dough will be at room 
        temperature and it would be easy to stretch it.</li>

        <li>The best way to make restaurant-style pizza is to use a pizza stone,
        as it helps the dough in rising and makes it crisp as well. Go for
        it.</li>

        <li>If you want to use an organic approach in your pizza, then you can
        use the fresh tomato puree or paste. This will make your pizza
        more delicious.</li>
